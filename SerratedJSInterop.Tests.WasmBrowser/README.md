Project intentionally named to be alphebetically before any RCL projects as work around for https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/100631


Test host for the .NET WebAssembly Browser template. Runs the SerratedJSInterop.Shared tests in a wasm-browser environment, and displays test results in browser. Requires the WebAssembly component from Visual Studio Installer and wasm-experimental workload.  May require reinstalling these after any update install of Visual Studio.
