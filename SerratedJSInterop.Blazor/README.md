# SerratedJSInterop.Blazor

This RCL/Razor Class Libary provides compatibility for SerratedJSInterop with Standalone Blazor WebAssembly.  Reference this Nuget package if you're using Blazor, and the SerratedJSInterop package will also be included via required dependency.

See solution [README.md](../README.md) for majority of usage instructions/examples, and the below for some additional Blazor platform-specific usage notes.

TODO: Format as important 
Note: This library targets the newer InteropServices/JSImport flavor of interop, rather than IJSRuntime more commonly used with Blazor.  Both can coexist in the same Blazor project, and often JSImport can perform better.



TODO: Detail Blazor-specific helpers.
